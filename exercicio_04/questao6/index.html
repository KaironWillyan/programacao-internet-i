    <p id="content">Take my hand, stay Joanne
        Heaven's not ready for you
        Every part of my aching heart
        Needs you more than the angels do
        Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
        Where do you think you're goin'
        Goin', girl?
        Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
        Where do you think you're goin'
        Goin', girl?
        If you could I know that you'd stay
        We both know things don't work that way
        I promised I wouldn't say goodbye
        So I grin and my voice gets thin
        Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
        Where do you think you're goin'?
        Goin', girl?
        Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
        Where do you think you're goin'?
        Goin', girl?
        Honestly, I know where you're goin'
        And baby, you're just movin' on
        And I still love you even if I can't
        See you anymore can't wait to see you soar
        Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
        Where do you think you're goin'
        Goin', girl?
        Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
        Where do you think you're goin'
        Goin', girl?</p>
